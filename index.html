            Impossibility:<br>
            -What you sow, shall you reap<br>
            A sterile seed, impossible breed.<br>
            - appearances collapse like an infamous theory<br>
            Complexions divide lovers' stereotypically<br>
            - girl or the boy, one has to settle<br>
            Its usually the one who suffers, mostly the latter.<br>
            -insecurities tie the tightest of knots.<br>
            He always gets hanged in this love's drought.<br>
            -best for him, better for her.<br>
            One has to settle for the loved one to prosper.<br>
            - letting go signifies love and respect<br>
            One has to care, cherish and then forget.<br>
            -bride she is to be, the lady of some other knight.<br>
            Its not the end of the world, just another lonely night<br>
