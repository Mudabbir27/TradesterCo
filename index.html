			Impossibility:
			-What you sow, shall you reap
			A sterile seed, impossible breed.
			- appearances collapse like an infamous theory
			Complexions divide lovers' stereotypically
			- girl or the boy, one has to settle
			Its usually the one who suffers, mostly the latter.
			-insecurities tie the tightest of knots.
			He always gets hanged in this love's drought.
			-best for him, better for her.
			One has to settle for the loved one to prosper.
			- letting go signifies love and respect
			One has to care, cherish and then forget.
			-bride she is to be, the lady of some other knight.
			Its not the end of the world, just another lonely night
